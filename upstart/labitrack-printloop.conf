# The example environment variables below assume that Node.js is installed by
# building from source with the standard settings.
#
# It should be easy enough to adapt to the paths to be appropriate to a package
# installation, but note that the packages available in the default repositories
# are far behind the times. Most users will be  building from source to get a
# more recent Node.js version.

    # the application fails immediately on launch. This is generally necessary
    # to avoid loading development servers to the point of failure every time
    # someone makes an error in application initialization code, or bringing
    # down production servers the same way if a database or other critical
    # service suddenly becomes inaccessible.
